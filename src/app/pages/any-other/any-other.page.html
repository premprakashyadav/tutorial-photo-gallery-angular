           <p>By using SURGICIAN Services, you agree to abide by these Terms and Conditions and those additional terms and conditions posted on the SURGICIAN website/mobile app from time to time:
           You agree that the following disclaimers form an essential part of the Terms and Conditions.
           You agree that SURGICIAN’s liability pursuant to these Terms and Conditions shall not under any circumstances, and regardless of whether the liability arises out of contract or tort, exceed the amount of the most recent subscription fee you have paid to SURGICIAN.
           The service provided by SURGICIAN.COM through the review of User’s Records is different from the diagnostic services typically provided by a physician during a face-to-face visit. Providing this service will not have the benefit of information that could be obtained by examining you in person and observing your physical condition. SURGICIAN.COM encourages you to share the SMO with your attending physician. You should always consult with your physician or other appropriate health care professionals before making any changes in diet, physical activity and/or drug therapy.
           By requesting a SMO Service, You acknowledge and agree that:
           The SMO received will be limited to the attending physician’s review of your personal health records;
           The SMO is not intended to replace a full medical evaluation or face-to-face visit with a physician;
           The Physician may not have important information that is usually obtained through a physical examination;
           You will communicate with your physician after receiving the SMO;
           The absence of physical examination may affect the Physician’s ability to give a complete opinion on User’s condition, disease or injury.
           SMO Services are for medical purposes only and not for use in any related litigation or malpractice matters. We suggest that you contact an attorney and/or related medical professional in your state, territory, or country of residence for further assistance in such matter.
